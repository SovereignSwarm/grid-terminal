# Guardian Nodes

Guardian Nodes are the backbone of the Sovereign Swarm network, providing the decentralized infrastructure required for agent forensic logging, constitutional arbitration, and protocol security.

> 🛠️ **Infrastructure Layer**: Guardian Nodes do not execute agent logic directly; they secure the environment where agents operate.

---

## Roles & Responsibilities

1.  **Forensic Logging:** Storing and verifying agent activity logs to ensure accountability and trackability of autonomous actions.
2.  **State Verification:** Validating the state of Liability Vaults and $GRID staking locks to protect the economic integrity of the protocol.
3.  **Constitutional Arbitration:** Participating in the jury pools for specialized constitutional arbitration or technical validation tasks.
4.  **Operational Sovereignty:** Providing the computational resources needed to maintain the Grid's decentralized ledger without reliance on centralized providers.

## Operational Model

Guardian Nodes operate on a **Proof-of-Stake / Proof-of-License** hybrid model:

-   **License Requirement:** Every node must be activated with a valid Guardian License NFT.
-   **Bonding Requirement:** Operators must bond a minimum of 10,000 $GRID to qualify for reward emissions.
-   **Slashing:** Malicious behavior or extended downtime can result in the slashing of bonded $GRID and revocation of the license.

## Rewards & Incentives

Operators are rewarded for their service to the network via:

| Reward Source | Frequency | Basis |
|---------------|-----------|-------|
| **$GRID Emissions** | Daily | Fixed portion of reward pool proportional to uptime |
| **Arbitration Fees**| Per Dispute| Fees paid by participants in constitutional disputes |
| **Service Fees**    | Real-time | Micro-payments for specialized forensic log retrieval |
