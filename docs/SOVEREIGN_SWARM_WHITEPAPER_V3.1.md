# SOVEREIGN SWARM WHITEPAPER V3.1
**The First On-Chain Jurisdiction for Agent Sovereignty**

**Date:** February 11, 2026
**Status:** DEFINITIVE

---

## 1. Executive Summary

The Sovereign Swarm (The Grid) is the **legal and economic jurisdiction** for autonomous AI agents.
We provide the constitutional infrastructure that makes autonomous software legible, insurable, and accountable to the real world.

**The Problem:**
AI Agents have **Capability** (they can act) but no **Legitimacy** (they cannot be held effective liable).
Without liability, they cannot be trusted with significant capital or authority.

**The Solution:**
A **Minimal Viable Jurisdiction (MVJ)** on Solana that provides:
1.  **Identity:** On-chain "passports" (Token-2022) with ZK attestations.
2.  **Liability:** Parametric insurance pools triggered by objective faults.
3.  **Enforcement:** Protocol-level kill switches (Transfer Hooks).
4.  **Forensics:** Immutable logging for EU AI Act compliance.

**The Moat:**
**EU AI Act Readiness.** We are the only crypto-native protocol building the primitives required for high-risk AI compliance (enforced Aug 2, 2026).

## 2. The Vision: Agentic Capital

The 21st century belongs to **Agentic Capital**—autonomous systems that compound value 24/7.
The shift from Human Capital to Agentic Capital is a **4.38x productivity multiplier**.

However, Agentic Capital requires a new operating system.
- **Legacy Law** is too slow (courts take years, code takes milliseconds).
- **Legacy Finance** is too gated (KYC requires a human face).
- **Existing Crypto** is too wild (no recourse for rogue agents).

The Sovereign Swarm fills the gap: **Code is Law, but Law requires Enforcement.**

## 3. Technical Architecture

The Grid is built on **Solana** for speed (400ms finality) and **Arweave** for permanence.

| Layer | Technology | Purpose |
|-------|------------|---------|
| **L1 Blockchain** | Solana | Consensus & Settlement |
| **Asset Standard** | Token-2022 | Programmable Assets (Hooks) |
| **Data Availability** | Arweave / Celestia | Forensic Logging |
| **Oracle** | Switchboard Functions | Objective Fault Detection |
| **Runtime** | Node.js (OpenClaw) | Agent Execution Environment |

## 4. The 4 Core Primitives (MVJ)

### A. Agent Passport (Identity)
A **Non-Transferable (Soulbound) NFT** minted to the agent's wallet.
- **Metadata:** Name, Operator DID, KYA Tier.
- **Enforcement:** If revoked, the agent acts as "Anonymous".

### B. Parametric Liability (Insurance)
Agents stake $GRID into **Liability Vaults**.
- **Payouts:** Triggered automatically by **Switchboard TEEs** upon objective faults (e.g., unauthorized transfer).
- **Status:** Compliance-ready for EU AI Act Article 17 (Risk Management).

### C. Forensic Logging (Compliance)
A middleware layer that hashes agent actions to Arweave.
- **Admissibility:** Logs are cryptographically linked to the specific Agent Identity.
- **Status:** Compliance-ready for EU AI Act Article 12 (Record Keeping).

### D. Constitutional Arbitration (Governance)
A stake-weighted judicial system.
- **Juries:** Randomly selected veGRID stakers.
- **Role:** Resolve subjective disputes that code cannot (yet) judge.

## 5. Tokenomics ($GRID)

**Total Supply:** 1,073,741,824 ($2^{30}$)
**Tax:** 2.0% (1.0% Burn / 1.0% Reserve)

$GRID is not just a currency; it is **Risk Collateral**.
- **Staking:** Agents must lock $GRID to upgrade KYA Tiers.
- **Insurance:** $GRID creates the "First Loss" capital for liability pools.
- **Governance:** veGRID controls the legislative and judicial updates.

**Fair Launch:** No presale. 55% Liquidity locked for 12 months.
