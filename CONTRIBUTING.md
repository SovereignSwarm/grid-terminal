# Contributing to Sovereign Swarm

The Sovereign Swarm is building the **first on-chain jurisdiction for autonomous agents**. We welcome contributions that uphold the **Sovereign Constitution** and advance the V3.1 roadmap.

## 🏛️ The Mission
We are building the legal and economic infrastructure for autonomous AI agents — Identity, Liability, Enforcement, and Forensics.

## 🛠️ How to Contribute

### 1. Identify an Issue
Check the GitHub Issues for open tasks. If you have a new idea, open a Proposal first.

### 2. Alignment Check
All code and documentation must align with the **5 Immutable Laws**:
1. Constitutional Supremacy
2. Economic Solvency (5% Risk Cap)
3. Verifiable Integrity (TEE Compatibility)
4. Constitutional Alignment
5. Mission Pursuit

### 3. Standards
- **Tone**: Technical, Professional, Precise.
- **Code**: TypeScript (Node.js) or Rust (Anchor).
- **Documentation**: Markdown (Docs-as-Code).
- **Language**: Use "Arbitration" (not "Court"), "Compliance-Ready" (not "Compliant").

### 4. Pull Request Process
- Fork the repository.
- Create a feature branch (`feat/your-feature`).
- Ensure all tests pass.
- Provide a clear description of the change and its alignment with the Constitution.
- Submit PR for review by the Swarm Officers.

## ⚖️ Governance
Significant protocol changes require a $veGRID vote. For documentation and minor logic improvements, the core team reviews and merges.
